# pfs-provisions
A drag-and-drop list of Pathfinder Provisions for Pathfinder Society, Paizo's Organized Play program for Pathfinder Second Edition.

Inspired by zarmstrong's PFS Consumables Compendia (https://github.com/zarmstrong/pfs-consumables)

Thanks to discord user redeux for helping me with putting this together

Uses a table made by discord user volfied, because it was much prettier than I could have done
