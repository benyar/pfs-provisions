# pfs-provisions
A drag-and-drop list of Pathfinder Provisions for Pathfinder Society, Paizo's Organized Play program for Pathfinder Second Edition.

Inspired by zarmstrong's PFS Consumables Compendia.

Thanks to redeux for helping me with putting this together

Uses a table made by volfied, because it was much prettier than I could have done
